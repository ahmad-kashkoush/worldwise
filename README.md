# Worldwise

## Description

This project is a simple web application that displays information about the
world's capitals. It uses React as a JavaScript library for building user
interfaces, Vite as a build tool, and a REST API provided by JSON Server to
fetch data.

The app allows users to navigate to different routes and view a list of visited
cities. It also utilizes Firebase for authentication and storing visited cities.
## Demo

## Features

- Responsive navigation bar with links to the homepage, pricing page, and a
  product page.
- A map view of the world with markers for each visited city.
- Ability to add cities by clicking on the map.
- Ability to delete cities from the list.
- Storing a list of visited cities in Firebase.
- User authentication.

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user
  interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Build tool that aims to provide a faster and
  leaner development environment compared to Create React App.
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server): Lightweight server for
  REST APIs.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Authentication and database
  services.
- JSX, CSS, JavaScript

## Concepts Involved

- CSS for styling and responsiveness
- Leaflet Map
- Custom Hooks
- Context API
- Routing: programmatic navigation
- Form handling: controlled components, form validation, input handling
- Data fetching: useEffect, fetch API, async/await
- Firebase Realtime Database: methods to insert, fetch, and delete from cities
  database
- React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useNavigate
