## Description

This project is a simple web application that displays information about the world's capitals. It uses React as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Vite as a build tool, and a REST API provided by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to fetch data.

The app allows users to navigate to different routes, filter cities by name, and toggle between a list view and a map view.

### Features

- Navigation bar with links to the homepage, pricing page, and a product page.
- Homepage with a list of all cities, a filter input, and buttons to toggle between list and map views.
- Pricing page with a simple pricing table.
- Product page with a form to contact the company.
- A map view of the world with markers for each city.
- A list view of cities with their name, country, population, and a marker on the map.
- Filter functionality in the list view.
